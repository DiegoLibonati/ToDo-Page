## Educational Purpose

This project was created primarily for **educational and learning purposes**.  
While it is well-structured and could technically be used in production, it is **not intended for commercialization**.  
The main goal is to explore and demonstrate best practices, patterns, and technologies in software development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Execute: `npm install`
4. Execute: `npm run dev`

The application will open automatically at `http://localhost:3000`

## Description

I made a web page that works like JIRA. It is a page where we can upload tasks to do, that are in progress or that are done. In addition we can delete all the tasks of each category separately, we can drag and drop the tasks from one category to another with drag and drop. Also by clicking with the wheel we can cross out the task and with the right click we can delete it from the dashboard.

1. Javascript
